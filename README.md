# ETL-Examples

I wanted to make some examples of basic ETLs with Python.

### API_to_CSV

In this first example, we'll perform the following:

1. Pull data from an API
2. Transform the data by cleaning up fields and building a new object
3. "Load" the data into a new storage form (in this case, a CSV)

### API_to_DB

In our second example, we will:

1. Pull data from an API
2. Transform the data by cleaning fields and building a new object
3. Validate, and load the data into a database
