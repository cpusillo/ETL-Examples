# ETL-Examples

I wanted to make some examples of basic ETLs with Python.

### API_to_CSV

In this first example, we'll perform the following:

1. Pull data from an API
2. Transform the data by cleaning up fields and building a new object
3. "Load" the data into a new storage form (in this case, a CSV)
